                        <p>Bow is typically a knot tied around two loose ends, that is what we do! We connect artisans and weavers to urban consumers directly. And Bee symbolises determination, teamwork and community power. BownBee together represents the community power that enables us to connect the two ends of traditional crafts and end-consumers.</p>
